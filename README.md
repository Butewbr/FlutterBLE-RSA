# BLE Device Scanner + Digitally Signed List Generator

This project was developed as part of a **selection challenge for the Laboratory of Computer Security (LabSEC)**.

The mobile app scans for BLE devices and creates a list containing the devices found. In the app, you can create a public/private key pair to digitally sign the list. You can see the keys and the resulting signature.
